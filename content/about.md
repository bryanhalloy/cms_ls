The **International Space Station** (ISS) is a remarkable symbol of international cooperation and scientific endeavor in space exploration. It is a large spacecraft in low Earth orbit where astronauts from various countries live and work. The ISS serves as a microgravity and space environment research laboratory, where scientific research is conducted in astrobiology, astronomy, meteorology, physics, and other fields. Its construction and operation represent a joint effort involving multiple space agencies, primarily NASA (United States), Roscosmos (Russia), ESA (European Space Agency), JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency), and CSA (Canadian Space Agency).
