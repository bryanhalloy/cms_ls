An administrator should be able to modify the list of users who may sign into the application by editing a configuration file using their text editor.

== make a folder called private
== make a yaml file called account_credentials
== in it store key/value of username/passwords

- on the login form
  -if username is in the list, it can login
  -if username not in list, error and "username not valid"


Modify the application to use test/users.yml to load user credentials during testing.
